            <h2>StorageManager and Peristed Storage</h2>
            <p>The StorageManager API gives web apps a way to discover how much storage quota is available for use by
                the app, as well as how much of the quota has currently been used.</p>
            <p>It also provides a way for installed Progressive Web Apps to indicate to the browser that their data
                should be preserved at a higher priority than other ephemeral data on the device.</p>
            <p>Storage quota: <span id="dtEst"></span></p>
            <p>Storage used: <span id="dtUsage"></span></p>
            <p>Storage persistence: <span id="dtPersisted"></span></p>

            <h2>Device Memory</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/device-memory/" target="_blank">device memory API</a> gives web
                applications the ability to detect how much on-board RAM a particular
                device has. You can use this information for several purposes, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Making run-time decisions about the resources to deliver to your app on the user's device. For
                    example, you might deliver a "light" version of your app to users with low-memory devices.</li>
                <li>Enhancing analytics that your app records in order to build a more accurate picture of the device
                    capabilites that your users have.</li>
            </ul>
