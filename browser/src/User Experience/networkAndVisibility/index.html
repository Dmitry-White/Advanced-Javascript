        <p>
          Web applications can detect the state of the network before attempting
          to access data and update their UX appropriately, as well as determine
          the quality and speed of the connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this sample, the status box below will turn either green for online
          or red for offline.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where available, it will also use the
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Network_Information_API"
            >Network Information API</a
          >
          to indicate the effective type of the connection as well as the
          estimated round-trip time for messages.

      <h1>Page Visibility Example</h1>
      <div id="content">
        <p>
          The PageVisibility API enables web apps to respond to changes in the
          visible state of the tab that they are running in. This is useful for
          a variety of scenarios:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pause and play video or audio content</li>
          <li>Slow down or pause network access when a tab is not visible</li>
          <li>Freeze the state of a game or other live content</li>
          <li>Only show notifications when the app is not visible</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This <code>div</code> element will update when the visibilitychange
          event fires in the tab:
        </p>
        <div id="targetElem">
          <!-- visibility change events will be recorded here -->
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
