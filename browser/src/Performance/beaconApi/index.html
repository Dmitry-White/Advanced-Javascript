      <p>
        The Beacon API provides a way of sending information to a server from
        your web page even after the page is closed. It's useful for scenarios
        such as recording analytics or other diagnostic information, when your
        web page doesn't need or expect a response from the server.
      </p>
      <p>
        It specifically addresses the case of sending data when a page is
        unloaded or navigated away from. Browsers typically ignore calls to
        XmlHttpRequest in <code>unload</code> event handlers.
