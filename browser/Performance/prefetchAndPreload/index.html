          The <code>prefetch</code> attribute can be used to give a hint to the
          browser to retrieve a resource very likely to be needed on the next
          navigation. With this information, the browser can determine whether
          it is worthwhile to load the resource in advance.
        </p>
        <p>
          This <a href="prefetch_page.html">link</a> is to another page. When
          identified with an appropriate
          <code>link</code>
          tag with <code>rel="prefetch"</code>, the page will be downloaded in
          advance by the browser and served from the cache when the user clicks
          the link.

          The <code>preload</code> attribute can be used to direct the browser
          to retrieve a resource very likely to be needed within the current
          page. To use this attribute, you need to specify the type of resource
          to be loaded.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is similar to the <code>prefetch</code> attribute, but that
          directive is used to prefetch resources that will be used on the next
          navigation, not the current page.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>div</code> element below has a background-image property
          applied. However, it is not loaded until the browser has parsed the
          CSS and identified the image. To speed up the loading process we can
          indicate to the browser that the image should be loaded ahead of time.
