/*
  A WeakMap is a collection of key/value pairs whose keys must be objects.

  Object's presence as a key in a WeakMap does not prevent the object
  from being garbage collected. Once an object used as a key has been collected,
  its corresponding values in any WeakMap become candidates for garbage collection as well.

  Why such a limitation? If an object has lost all other references,
  then it is to be garbage-collected automatically.
  But technically itâ€™s not exactly specified when the cleanup happens.
  So, technically, the current element count of a WeakMap is not known.
  Element list depends on the state of garbage collection,
  and as a result - non-deterministic in nature.
  For that reason, methods that access all keys/values are not supported.

  Usage:
    - third-party code data storage
    - object caching
    - memory leak and performance optimazation
